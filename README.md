# 30DaysOfNLP

<h2> Day 6 </h2> – 

<p><b>Shallow transfer learning for NLP</b> - It’s all about using pre-trained embedding in a semi-supervised manner to transfer pre-trained knowledge to a problem
Using pre-trained embedding of not just words, but sentences/paragraphs. The Neural Network models that provide these embedding are shallow(do not have many layers)
Cross-lingual learning- when transfer learning happens between different languages
Multi-task learning – when transfer learning happens between different task
Domain adaptation- when TF happens across domains </p>
